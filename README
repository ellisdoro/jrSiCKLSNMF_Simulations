This contains all of the data generated for the simulation studies for jrSiCKLSNMF. 
Every simulated dataset contains a list of two X matrices and a list of two L matrices.

The X list of matrices contains the simulated single-cell data while the L matrices contain 
constructed graphs. If they are marked as bulk, the graphs are generated from simulated
bulk data.

If there is no number after the folder name, the files contain no added noise. 25 is the 
smallest amount of added noise, 50 is second, and 100 is the most.

The first item in the list of X matrices is a gene by cell matrix of simulated scRNA-seq counts
and the second is a peak by cell matrix of simulated scATAC-seq counts. Similarly, the L list contains
two matrices, which are KNN graphs of the feature-feature similarity for each view.

For all datasets, cells 1-100 are simulated HEK2, cells 101-200 are simulated HepG2 cells, 
and cells 201-300 are simulated Mix cells.

One can generate the true cell types in R via:

truth<-c(rep("HEK293",100),rep("HepG2",100),rep("Mix",100))
